## Introduction

> This application can be used to keep track of your bookmarks (links). The two fields required are the website title and the url. Once this is submitted, the application will build a list of bookmarks, which can be deleted or marked as read. Marking a bookmark as read changes the styling of the bookmark to indicate it's been read. There is also totals displayed for number of bookmarks and how many are read/unread.
